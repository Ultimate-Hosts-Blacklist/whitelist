The Ultimate Hosts Blacklist whitelist list
============================================

This branch serves the whitelist list which is used by the Ultimate Hosts Blacklist Project.

Whitelisting tool
-----------------

Because our list is not just a "normal" list, we have a tool which understands the list and process the whitelisting for us.

It can be found in the `script branch`_.
