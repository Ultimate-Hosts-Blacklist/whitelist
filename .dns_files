# This files contains the list of files which are parsed into 
# our (future to be) Public DNS Service.
# 
# How does it works? 
#
#    The server will fetch this file, read each lines,
#    try to fetch:
#        https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/whitelist/raw/master/${line}
#
#    If it is successful, the file will be parsed to the whitelisting tool which
#    is applied before each update/reload of the DNS server. 
#
#    If it is not successful, the parser will follow the next line, and so on...
#
#    Of course, each lines which starts with "#" will be ignored.
#
# Who can update this file?
#
#    Everybody who have write access to this file and repository.
#
# Notes:
#    
#    * The DNS server will fetch this file (and every other listed here) every day
#      around 19:10 UTC.
#    * If not around 19:10 UTC because of an issue or any reasone,
#      it will be reported into the latest feedback
#      tracker at https://github.com/Ultimate-Hosts-Blacklist/dev-center.
